</p>	
<p class="text-small">Jeans are not labeled as pre-shrunk or faded, then you may have purchased “raw denim” – that is, denim that hasn’t been shrunken or had its dye set during manufacturing. This allows you to wear your jeans so they mold to your body and develop their own unique fading patterns over time.</p>

       <p class="sectionTag text-big">The best quality of denim is here.</p>
       <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">When it comes to caring for denim jeans, there are a few things that can cause the dye to fade: washing, drying, the buildup of dirt and oil, and regular wear. Gentle machine-washing cleanses your jeans of oils and dirt.

Turn your jeans inside-out and zip them up. Turning your jeans inside-out will maximize contact with the part of the jeans that touched your skin (and its oils and sweat) and minimize contact with the indigo dye. Zip them up so that the zipper won’t snag on any fabric.
Select your detergent. When washing jeans, use laundry detergent designed for dark clothing to prevent fading. Avoid bleach, which can permanently damage the indigo dye, and skip the fabric softener, which can build up in denim fabrics. Alternatively, you can use half a cup of distilled white vinegar in lieu of detergent. In addition to neutralizing odors, vinegar can also set colors, making it a great option for black jeans or brand new jeans that you’re washing for the first time.
Wash denim with like colors. Although you may want to wash a new pair of jeans alone the first time to prevent dye transfer, it's okay to combine dark jeans with like colors (black, gray, and dark blue) on subsequent washes. Since denim is heavy and holds water, avoid washing more than two pairs of jeans together.

       <p class="sectionTag text-big">Bleach Wash.</p>
       <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">In bleach wash, a strong oxidative bleaching agent is added during the washing, with or without pumice stones. The purpose of the bleaching is to decolourise the dark blue shade by destroying the indigo dye molecules with oxidative bleaching chemicals.
        Because the crotch is a curve, do not use one piece of tape to go around the seam. You need to tape the seam in sections so you have no gaps under the tape when you are curving it. Start from the top and once you get to the curve, tape past the curve not following the angle and cut, Then start taping again with the right angle and overlapping the previous tape. Repeat all the way around

To protect around the pockets, tape around the whole pocket and place a plastic bag inside the jeans to prevent the bleach seeping through to the front panel.
